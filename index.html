            <p>Texas is one of the largest states in the United States. It's located just north of Mexico and is otherwise bordered by the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Louisiana. Its nickname is the Lone Star State because it used to be an independant republic. It is the second most populated state in the US with over 30 million people. The traditional image of the Texan cowboy is heavily shaped by its dominance in the cattle industry.</p>
